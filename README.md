# watcher

### newDate() is king
Yes, this small js-project is just a clock. But it does not calculate its operations every second, it converts the milliseconds of the global newDate(). Why? 'Cause i wanted the hands of my clock move smoothly. 


### As a designer i apologize ...
... for what i designed here, but this project was more about js. And that was challenging and fun, too. 


### What a deal!
This repo includes not just a watch. It also includes a stopwatch. But wait, there is more... Yes, itÂ´s a countdown. 3 in 1 repo? What a deal? I know someone somewhere somehow can do this in just 12 lines, which is very cool. 


### The pros of tomorrow
Maybe it will inspire other beginners as well to try, experiment and celebrate their own successes. Because the pros today are what we're yet to be. 


### And so ...
... have fun with this "adventure" in code.
