# watcher
watcher - stopwatcher - countdowner

This is "only" a small js-project of a clock. It does not calculate itself every second but converts the milliseconds of the global date object.

I'm sure it can be done a thousand times more efficiently, and someone somewhere somehowcan do this in just 12 lines, which is very cool. 

But this is my clock, my stopwatch and my countdown. And I'm proud of this little project. And maybe it will inspire other beginners as well to try, experiment and celebrate their own successes. 

Because the pros today are what we're yet to be. 

And so, have fun with this "adventure" in code.
